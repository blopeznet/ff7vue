### Main Content

A few years ago when I started working as a programmer, my favorite game was Final Fantasy VII. Now, a long time later, I've written this code to adapt and utilize Vue 3 and bring this mini-app to completion. You can play a game if you want.

### Disclaimer

Disclaimer: I've made this project without any economic interest and on a personal basis, as a technical demo of the capabilities of Vue 3 technology, and my small tribute to the FFVII world.
